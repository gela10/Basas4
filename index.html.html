        <h2>My Favorite Hobbies</h2>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy the following activities that bring me joy and relaxation:</p>

        <ul class="hobby-list">
            <li><strong>Sleeping:</strong> There’s nothing more relaxing than a good night's sleep. I believe rest is essential for a healthy life and try to get as much sleep as my body needs each day.</li>
            <li><strong>Eating:</strong> I love exploring new foods and flavors. Eating is not just about nourishment, it’s an experience to savor each bite and enjoy the company of others while dining.</li>
            <li><strong>Cleaning:</strong> A clean space makes me feel at ease. I find joy in tidying up my surroundings and keeping things organized, which helps me stay calm and productive.</li>
            <li><strong>Cooking:</strong> Cooking is one of my greatest passions. I love trying out new recipes and experimenting in the kitchen. There’s something special about preparing a meal from scratch and sharing it with others.</li>
        </ul>
